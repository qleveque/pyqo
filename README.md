```

## Command ``d``

Open the file manager to your favourite directories with ease.
The command `d` shares its data with the command `c`.
See `d --help` for more details.

### Example

## Command ``c``

Set the working directory of the command line to your favourite directories with ease.
For a script to alter the current environment, it requires `source`'ing in linux.

$ cd ~/Documents/games
$ # associate permanently the key 'games' to '~/Documents/games'
